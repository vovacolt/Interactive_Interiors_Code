Description:
=========================
This project is a prototype of an interactive interior configurator based on educational content UE4 Realistic Rendering. Only the daytime map and some meshes with textures and materials remained from the training project.

To fill the project, we used public assets from the Epic Games Store, as well as materials from the Quixel Megascans library. The project was implemented as a desktop branch of another project related to architectural visualization.

The goal of this project is to show interested developers what a modern interactive architectural visualization of an interior can look like. Demonstrate how you can work with design and furnishing solutions in a virtual space.


The following functionality was implemented:
=========================
+ Replacing furniture meshes.
+ Replacement of material for walls and ceilings.
+ Change the color of the material of furniture, walls and light sources.
+ Rearrange, add and remove furniture.
+ Turn on turn off the light.
+ Adjusted the physics of objects.
+ Basic functionality for working with sound by the environment: adjusting the sound volume, turning on and off musical accompaniment.

Also in the project, work was done with light. Technologies such as Real Time Ray Tracing were connected and used.
